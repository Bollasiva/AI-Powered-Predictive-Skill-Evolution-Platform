This version is:  
- **Complete:** Includes Overview, Features, Tech Stack, Project Structure, Usage, Contribution, and License.  
- **Professional:** Clear headings, concise descriptions.  
- **GitHub-friendly:** Easy for others to navigate and understand your repo.  

If you want, I can also **write a super short, recruiter-friendly “summary” section** at the top of the README that immediately shows the impact of your project in 2–3 lines. It’s very useful for GitHub portfolio projects.  

Do you want me to add that?
